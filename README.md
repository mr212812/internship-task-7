# Sales Analysis with SQL and Python

This project demonstrates how to use **SQL inside Python** (with SQLite) to analyze simple sales data.

## Steps Performed
- Created a SQLite database (`sales_data.db`) with a `sales` table.
- Inserted sample sales data (product, quantity, price).
- Ran SQL queries to calculate:
  - Total quantity sold per product
  - Total revenue per product
- Displayed results using **Pandas** and a **Matplotlib bar chart**.

## Tools Used
- Python (SQLite3, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Output
- Tabular summary of sales  
- Bar chart showing revenue by product
